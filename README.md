### Diamonds Analysis
Demonstrated the basics of the most common Python Libraries (Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib) by visualizing the data in a pre-defined dataset.

### Housing Analysis
Utilized R libraries tidyverse, reshape2, and boot to clean and analyze data regarding the housing market. This project required substantial cleaning and manipulation showing a complex process of organizing categorical data points. This included data splitting and model building.

### Insurance Analysis
Utilized Pythyon Libraries (Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib) to conduct a Linear Regression after encoding categorical data.

### Loan Analysis
This page utilized Bootstrap 4 and demonstrates the basics of Bootstrap. This page contains a jumbotron, pill boxes, navbar, cards, etc.

### Real Estate Analysis
